								<h3>Transportation Collective</h3>
						</a>
								<p>The Transportation Collective was founded out of IIT's IPRO program. The IPRO program is a class required by all ungraduates to be taken twice. The idea of an IPRO is to merge multiple diciplines together, and encourage cross-diciplinary innovation.</p>
								<p>I absolutely love the idea of this, and was excited to jump into it. Since I have interests in Data Engineering, I knew that the IPRO titled <b>Microsoft: Big Data Science and the Urban Experience</b> (sponsored by Microsoft and Motorola Solutions) was perfect for me.</p>
								<p>The goal of this class was to utilize Big Data regarding the City of Chicago, and use that parsed data to improve Public Saftey in any way you'd like.</p>
								<p>Together, with our many disciplines, we came up with a solution to the inefficiency of reporting problems to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA).</p>

							    	<li>Data Science</li>
							    	<li>Back-End</li>

								<h3>Database Organization Final Project</h3>
						</a>
								<p>The fruition on our semester long efforts in CS 425 to build an entire website for a student forum, using the tools and methods learned in the class. I did all of the PHP and HTML integration of the MySQL Database.</p>
